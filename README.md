# Commander Tracker (EDH) — iPhone PWA

Static, dependency-free Progressive Web App for Magic: The Gathering Commander games.
Everything lives in `public/` (plain HTML/CSS/JS). There's no build step and no backend. Data is kept in `localStorage` on the device.

## Files
- `public/index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`: the app
- `public/sw.js`: service worker (offline cache). Bump `CACHE` when you deploy changes.
- `public/manifest.json`, `public/icons/`: PWA manifest + icons (180, 192, 512, maskable 512)
- `tools/test.mjs`: Playwright end-to-end test (iPhone 390x844). `tools/make-icons.mjs` regenerates the icons.
- `screenshots/`: screenshots from the test run
- `commander-tracker.zip`: contents of `public/`, ready to upload to any static host

## Run locally
    python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory public
    # then (needs playwright-core in tools/ and Chrome):
    node tools/test.mjs

## Hosting (needs a stable HTTPS URL — localStorage is tied to the origin)
Any static host works. Serve the contents of `public/` (or the zip) at a fixed URL, e.g.:
- GitHub Pages: push `public/` contents to a repo, then enable Pages. All paths are relative, so a `/repo/` subpath works.
- Netlify Drop (app.netlify.com/drop): drag the unzipped folder in.
- Cloudflare Pages / Vercel: upload the folder as a static site.

Once it's hosted, open the URL in Safari on the iPhone, then Share → Add to Home Screen.
Don't change the URL afterwards, or the data will be left behind at the old address. Use Settings → Export JSON for backups.
